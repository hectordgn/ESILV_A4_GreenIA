# Green AI Project – Predicting Forest Fire Risk

## Project Description
This project aims to predict wildfire  and deforestation risk using open-source environmental tabular data.  
Our goal is to build a lightweight and energy-efficient machine learning model following Green AI principles.

## Dataset
We explore several open-source datasets:
- UCI Forest Fires
- Fire Weather Index (FWI)
- NASA FIRMS fire detections

The final selected dataset will be documented in the `data/` folder.

## Machine Learning Model
We use simple, low-carbon ML models such as:
- Random Forest (the best)
- Logistic Regression
- XGBoost (if needed)

Evaluation includes:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  
- Confusion matrix  
- ROC curve / AUC
